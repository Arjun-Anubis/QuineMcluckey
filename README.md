# Introduction
The Quine Mucluckey algorithm or the tabular method is an algorithm to find the minimal sum of products or product of sum representation for a given truth table in many variables
This can be used in place of a karnaugh map when the number of inputs is very large, it also ensures that the minimal form is reached. It follows essentially the same principle as a kmap to find the prime implicants of a truth table
